It has been a while....

And yes I am still working on the NixStick *(what a surprise right?)*. I know I haven't posted in a while because to be honest I was getting a bit **TOO** obsessed with the progress I am getting. I will make a separate post but what I want this post to show that I am very glad to have my work featured on [CanadaRobotix](https://www.canadarobotix.com/)! Within their [blog section](https://www.canadarobotix.com/blogs/news), they have made a **4 part series** based on the blog posts that I made here. I have bought most of my electronics at this store *(and another but unfortunately it has been permanently closed)* so I highly recommend people check it out!
