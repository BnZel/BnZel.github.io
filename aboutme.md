You can call me Jay. I am a extremely curious individual and I enjoy all things software and hardware. Learning is something I love to do, regardless of the subject.

This is my homelab, where I do all my programming and electronics projects. Here's my current setup:

* MSI Katana GF66 running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* ASUS MB16AHV Monitor
* Raspberry Pi 4B that is running Samba NAS
* Raspberry Pi Zero W that is running WireGuard and Motioneye
* A LED matrix clock I built using the ATMega328p
* Generic whiteboard from Staples
* ThinkPad Edge E545 running Linux Mint 21.2 (Server)
